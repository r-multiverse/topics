An R-multiverse topic is a list of packages that share a subject matter area.

## New topics

To contribute a new topic, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/r-multiverse/topics/pulls) to add a [topic listing file](https://github.com/r-multiverse/topics/tree/main/topics) that describes the topic.

## New packages

To contribute a new package to an existing topic, add the topic URL to the URL field of the DESCRIPTION file ([example here](https://github.com/ropensci/stantargets/blob/db7d119ea0599eac3ce01a42bee27c9908754943/DESCRIPTION#L22)), then create a new GitHub/GitLab release of the package.
